  The idea is to think in something like a greedy algorithm.
  Always we have to find the n/m fraction... So split all the n sausages in m pieces. Now it's nedeed to select n units of these
  small pieces trying to solve the problem for one of the tasters and if it's nedeed we do a real division and increase the answer.
  After this we try to select n units of the rest to solve the problem for more one taster. We continue doing this.
  The inicial splits are only to help us think in fractions.
